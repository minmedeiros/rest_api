# Simple Rest API on Python

This simple project was created for testing Rest API backend on Python 3

## Description and Improves

It deals with 2 tables from "bots" database, which was already created with DB browser
The botslist table can add/remove users from db and return desired user info
The messageslist table can only add messages or return messages to user

They could be based on a structure,
The functions could return more information (they are mostly printing data and status)
There should also be an interface
Etc...
But, as I mentioned, this is supposed to be a simple project for testing Rest API

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3 installed and the mentioned libraries

## Getting Started

To visualize what I said, you should download the files and:

- First, run "mainRest.py" to load server and requests
- "mainFunc" stores functions to deal with these requests
- "testFunc" calls "mainFunc" class to test liability of functionalities
